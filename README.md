# earthquake-triangulation-activity
Materials for jupyter notebook-based earthquake triangulation activity used for science outreach. 

`notebooks/SMOrES_Earthquake_Triangulation_Activity.ipynb` is a Python-based jupyter notebook in which the user locates an earthquake's epicenter using the earthquake triangulation method. While Python is required to navigate the notebook, the code has been simplified so that the activity would be accessible to anyone and serve to expose users to python. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab.
