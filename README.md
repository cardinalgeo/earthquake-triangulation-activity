# earthquake-triangulation-activity
Materials for jupyter notebook-based earthquake triangulation activity used for science outreach. 

`notebooks/SMOrES_Earthquake_Triangulation_Activity.ipynb` was designed as a component of an eruption forecasting and response activity run by "Students of McGill Outreach in Earth Sciences" (SMOrES), the outreach group for the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University, Montreal. This subset of the activity is a Python-based jupyter notebook in which participants locate an earthquake's epicenter using the earthquake triangulation method. While Python is required to navigate the notebook, the code has been simplified so that the activity is  accessible to anyone, including non-coders, for whom it serves as a simple introduction to Python. The notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab.
