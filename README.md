# earthquake-triangulation-activity
Materials for jupyter notebook-based earthquake triangulation activity used for science outreach. 

`notebooks/SMOrES_Earthquake_Triangulation_Activity.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook designed to be run in Google Colab. The activity involves locating an earthquake's epicenter using the earthquake triangulation method. While Python is required to navigate the notebook, the code has been simplified so that the activity would be accessible to anyone and serve to expose users to python.
